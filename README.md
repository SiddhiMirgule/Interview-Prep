# Practising  DSA

Java DSA | Algorithms | Problem-solving | Interview Prep

This repository contains my personal notes and practice solutions while learning Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. I created this repo to keep track of my progress, strengthen my problem-solving skills, and prepare for technical interviews.

I believe the best way to learn DSA is by understanding the concept clearly and then solving as many problems as possible. So in this repository, you’ll find:
:Clean explanations of concepts
:Time and space complexity notes
:Java code templates
:Important problem-solving patterns
:Common mistakes to avoid
:Practice problems I’ve worked on

-I update this repository regularly as I learn new topics and solve more problems.
